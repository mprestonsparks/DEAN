# CLAUDE.md Investigation - Impact on MCP Tool Access

**Date**: June 23, 2025  
**Time Started**: 15:50:00 CDT  
**Purpose**: Determine if changes to CLAUDE.md files caused the loss of remote_exec tool access

---

## Phase 1: Locate and Examine CLAUDE.md Files

### Findings:
- Found one CLAUDE.md file in the current DEAN repository
- The file was recently created (commit 5df8d3b: "Add repository-specific CLAUDE.md guidance")
- No other CLAUDE.md variants found in the project

### Current CLAUDE.md Content:
- Contains repository-specific guidance for DEAN
- Focuses on implementation standards (NO MOCK IMPLEMENTATIONS)
- Includes service integration rules and architecture guidelines
- **Did NOT contain any MCP tool documentation**

---

## Phase 2: Check Git History for Changes

### Git History Analysis:
- CLAUDE.md was created recently with only one commit
- The file was added as a new file, not modified from a previous version
- No history of remote_exec ever being mentioned in CLAUDE.md

### Key Finding:
**The remote_exec tool was NEVER documented in CLAUDE.md**

---

## Phase 3: Search for Tool Documentation Across History

### Historical Search Results:
- No historical references to remote_exec in any markdown files in git history
- No mentions of MCP tools or the deployment PC (10.7.0.2) in committed documentation
- The tool appears to have been set up without being documented in the repository

---

## Phase 4: Examine Backup or Alternative Documentation

### Backup Search:
- No backup files found (*backup*, *old*, *.bak)
- Tool references only found in recent diagnostic files created during this investigation
- Parent workspace CLAUDE.md exists but doesn't contain remote_exec documentation

---

## Phase 5: Create Restored Documentation

### Documentation Added to CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
## Available MCP Tools

### remote_exec
- **Location**: `/Users/preston/dev/mcp-tools/remote_exec/remote_exec_launcher.sh`
- **Purpose**: Execute PowerShell commands on Windows deployment PC (10.7.0.2)
- **Usage**: The remote_exec tool allows execution of PowerShell scripts on the remote Windows deployment server
- **SSH Key**: `~/.ssh/claude_remote_exec`
- **Target**: `deployer@10.7.0.2`
- **Configuration**: MCP configuration is in `.mcp.json` in the project root
```

### Changes Committed:
- Commit: 00b9df1 "docs: Add remote_exec MCP tool documentation to CLAUDE.md"
- Added comprehensive MCP tools section
- Documented the correct tool location and configuration

---

## Phase 6: Test Tool Access After Documentation Update

The tool access issue was already resolved by fixing the `.mcp.json` configuration file path. The CLAUDE.md documentation update provides reference information but does not affect tool accessibility.

---

## Phase 7: Investigation Conclusions

### 1. What CLAUDE.md files were found:
- Only one CLAUDE.md in the DEAN repository
- Recently created with no prior history
- Parent workspace has separate CLAUDE.md

### 2. Was remote_exec previously documented in CLAUDE.md:
**NO** - The tool was never documented in any CLAUDE.md file

### 3. Recent changes to CLAUDE.md:
- File was newly created (not modified)
- No changes that could have removed tool documentation

### 4. Did adding tool documentation restore access:
**NO** - Tool access was restored by fixing `.mcp.json` configuration, not by updating CLAUDE.md

### 5. Conclusion:

**CLAUDE.md changes did NOT cause the loss of remote_exec tool access.**

The root cause was:
1. The `.mcp.json` configuration file had an incorrect path
2. It pointed to `~/claude-remote-exec/remote_exec_server.py` (non-existent)
3. The actual tool was at `~/dev/mcp-tools/remote_exec/remote_exec_launcher.sh`

The issue was resolved by correcting the path in `.mcp.json`. The CLAUDE.md documentation update is beneficial for future reference but was not related to the tool access problem.

### Key Learning:
- MCP tool access is controlled by `.mcp.json` configuration files
- CLAUDE.md serves as documentation but doesn't affect tool discovery
- Proper configuration management is critical for tool persistence
