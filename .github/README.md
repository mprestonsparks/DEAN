# GitHub Configuration

This directory contains GitHub-specific configuration files for the DEAN orchestration repository.

## Contents

- `workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflow definitions for CI/CD pipelines

## Purpose

The `.github` directory manages automated processes including:
- Continuous Integration testing
- Deployment automation
- Code quality checks
- Security scanning

All workflows are designed to validate the orchestration layer without modifying external repositories.
