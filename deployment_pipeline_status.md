## Phase 1: Tool Verification Results

### Test 1: Simple Connectivity Test
**Timestamp**: 2025-06-23 16:00:00

```
Remote execution tool is working!
Current time on deployment PC: 06/23/2025 18:39:04
Hostname: PC
```

**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS - SSH connectivity working perfectly

### Test 2: User Context and Permissions
**Timestamp**: 2025-06-23 16:01:00

```
Current user: deployer
User home: C:\Users\deployer.PC
Can write to C drive: NO - Write access denied
```

**Result**: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS - User context confirmed but no write access to C:\ root
**Note**: This is expected behavior. We'll need to create directories in user space or request elevated permissions.
