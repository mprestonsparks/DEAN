# Runtime Database Configuration Fix

## Problem Summary
The DEAN system codebase is correctly configured to use database name "dean_production", but the runtime environment is attempting to connect to "dean_prod", causing persistent connection failures.

## Root Cause
The issue is in the runtime environment configuration, specifically:
- The `.env` file contains `POSTGRES_DB=dean_prod` instead of `POSTGRES_DB=dean_production`
- This causes the application to attempt connections to a non-existent database

## Solution
1. Run the diagnostic script to identify the issue:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\fix_runtime_database_config.ps1
   ```

2. Apply the automatic fix:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\fix_runtime_database_config.ps1 -AutoFix
   ```

3. Restart Docker containers to apply changes:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

## Verification
After applying the fix, verify the correction:
```bash
./scripts/verify_docker_database.sh
```

## Prevention
Always use `.env.production.template` as the reference for environment configuration. The correct database name is "dean_production", not "dean_prod".
