# Connectivity Diagnosis Report

**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Issue:** Unable to connect to Windows deployment host (10.7.0.2)  
**Status:** RESOLVED - WireGuard VPN restarted successfully

## Executive Summary

The connection failure to the Windows deployment host at 10.7.0.2 was caused by the WireGuard VPN not automatically restarting after a system reboot. The issue has been resolved by manually restarting WireGuard with `sudo wg-quick up wg0`. All connectivity has been restored and verified.

## Network Test Results

### Basic Connectivity
```
ping -c 5 10.7.0.2
--- 10.7.0.2 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss
```

### Network Interfaces
- **Active:** en0 (192.168.100.67/24) - Local network only
- **Missing:** wg0 - WireGuard interface not present
- **Status:** No interface configured for 10.7.x.x network

### Routing Table
- **Result:** No routes to 10.7.0.0/24 network
- **Expected:** Route via WireGuard interface (wg0)

## WireGuard Status and Configuration

### Interface Status
```
ifconfig wg0
ifconfig: interface wg0 does not exist
```

### Process Status
- **WireGuard Process:** Not running
- **wg-quick:** Installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/wg-quick`
- **Configuration:** Found at `/usr/local/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` (requires sudo to read)

### Service Registration
- **launchctl:** No WireGuard service registered
- **Auto-start:** Not configured

## SSH Test Outcomes

### Key Configuration
- **Private Key:** `~/.ssh/claude_remote_exec` (permissions: 600)
- **Public Key:** `~/.ssh/claude_remote_exec.pub` (permissions: 644)
- **SSH Config:** No specific configuration for 10.7.0.2

### Connection Attempt
```
ssh -v -o ConnectTimeout=10 deployer@10.7.0.2
debug1: Connecting to 10.7.0.2 [10.7.0.2] port 22.
debug1: connect to address 10.7.0.2 port 22: Operation timed out
```

**Error:** Connection timeout - No route to host

## Remote_exec Tool Status

### MCP Registration
- **Tool:** Registered as `remote_exec`
- **Launcher:** `/Users/preston/dev/mcp-tools/remote_exec/remote_exec_launcher.sh`
- **Configuration:**
  - Host: 10.7.0.2
  - User: deployer
  - Key: ~/.ssh/claude_remote_exec

### Tool Readiness
- **Status:** Configured correctly
- **Issue:** Cannot connect due to missing VPN

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue is that **WireGuard VPN is not running**. This is preventing:
1. Network connectivity to the 10.7.0.0/24 subnet
2. SSH access to the deployment host
3. Remote_exec MCP tool functionality

## Last Known Working Timestamp

Unable to determine from available logs. The WireGuard configuration was created on June 20, 2025 at 13:19.

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### 1. Start WireGuard VPN (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

### 2. Verify Connection
After starting WireGuard:
```bash
# Check interface
ifconfig wg0

# Test connectivity
ping -c 3 10.7.0.2

# Test SSH
ssh -i ~/.ssh/claude_remote_exec deployer@10.7.0.2 "echo Connected"
```

### 3. Configure Auto-Start (RECOMMENDED)
Create a launchd service to start WireGuard automatically:
```bash
# Create plist file for auto-start
sudo tee /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.wireguard.wg0.plist << EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.wireguard.wg0</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/opt/homebrew/bin/wg-quick</string>
        <string>up</string>
        <string>wg0</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/var/log/wireguard.err</string>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/var/log/wireguard.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

# Load the service
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.wireguard.wg0.plist
```

### 4. Monitor VPN Status
Add monitoring to ensure VPN stays connected:
```bash
# Add to crontab
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/pgrep wg-quick || sudo /opt/homebrew/bin/wg-quick up wg0
```

## Alternative Connection Methods

No alternative methods are available as the deployment host is only accessible via the VPN-protected network.

## Conclusion

The connectivity failure is due to WireGuard VPN not being active. This is a simple fix that requires starting the WireGuard service with `sudo wg-quick up wg0`. Once the VPN is established, all connectivity to the deployment host should be restored.

## Resolution Update

**Issue Resolved:** June 24, 2025 at 12:23 PM

The WireGuard VPN was successfully restarted using the recommended command:
```bash
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

**Verification Results:**
- Remote_exec tool connection: ✅ Successful
- DEAN services accessible: ✅ All healthy
- Container operations: ✅ Functional
- SSH connectivity: ✅ Restored

**Root Cause:** The development machine was restarted, and WireGuard was not configured to start automatically at boot. This is a known configuration gap that should be addressed using the auto-start configuration provided in the recommendations section above.
