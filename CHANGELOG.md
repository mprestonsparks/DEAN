# Changelog

All notable changes to the DEAN (Distributed Evolutionary Agent Network) project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- Initial beta release of DEAN system
- Complete microservices architecture implementation
- Real agent creation and evolution functionality
- Token economy with budget enforcement
- Pattern discovery and storage capabilities
- Integration with cellular automata rules (30, 90, 110, 184)
- PostgreSQL persistence with full schema
- Redis caching for agent registry
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboard infrastructure
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Integration test suite
- Operational runbook
- Distributed architecture across 4 repositories

### Architecture Decisions
- **Distributed System Design**: Separated concerns across DEAN, IndexAgent, infra, and airflow-hub repositories
- **REST API Communication**: All inter-service communication via REST APIs (no direct cross-repository imports)
- **Token Economy**: Implemented finite resource system to enforce efficiency
- **Cellular Automata**: Chose rules 30, 90, 110, 184 for diverse evolution strategies
- **Schema Design**: Normalized database with proper foreign key constraints

### Changed
- Refactored Evolution API to standalone implementation (removed cross-repository dependencies)
- Updated integration tests to match actual API endpoints
- Modified performance_metrics queries to match actual schema

### Fixed
- Evolution API module import errors
- Database schema initialization issues
- Service health check endpoint paths
- Docker compose configuration for proper service dependencies

### Security
- ⚠️ **WARNING**: JWT authentication not yet implemented (required before production use)
- All endpoints currently unprotected
- Service-to-service communication lacks authentication

### Known Issues
- Missing DEAN Orchestrator endpoints (/api/v1/agents/spawn)
- Airflow DAGs not automatically deployed
- EFK logging stack requires manual configuration
- Some integration tests fail due to missing endpoints

## Breaking Changes Log

### v1.0.0-beta
- Initial release - no breaking changes

### Future Considerations
When implementing authentication:
- All API endpoints will require JWT tokens
- Service-to-service communication will need API keys
- Existing integrations will need authentication headers

---

## Migration Notes

### From Development to v1.0.0-beta
1. Initialize database schema using `init_agent_evolution.sql`
2. Update Evolution API to use standalone implementation
3. Configure environment variables per `.env.template`
4. Deploy using `docker-compose.dean-complete.yml`
