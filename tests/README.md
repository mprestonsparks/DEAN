# DEAN Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive testing for the DEAN orchestration system.

## Directory Structure

- `unit/` - Unit tests for individual components
  - `orchestration/` - Tests for orchestration logic
  - `interfaces/` - Tests for CLI and web interfaces
  - `integration/` - Tests for service clients

- `integration/` - Integration tests for cross-service functionality
  - End-to-end workflow tests
  - Service communication tests
  - Deployment validation tests

- `fixtures/` - Test fixtures and utilities
  - Mock service implementations
  - Test configurations
  - Sample data

## Purpose

The test suite ensures:

1. **Component Reliability**: Unit tests validate individual component behavior
2. **Integration Stability**: Integration tests verify cross-service workflows
3. **Regression Prevention**: Automated testing catches breaking changes
4. **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of expected behavior

## Testing Philosophy

- Test in isolation using mocks for external services
- No modification of external repositories during testing
- Clear test naming that describes expected behavior
- Comprehensive error case coverage
- Performance benchmarking for critical paths
