## Reporting a Vulnerability

The DEAN team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the following process:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security@dean-orchestration.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Your recommended fix (if any)
3. You should receive a response within 48 hours
4. We will work with you to understand and validate the issue
5. Once fixed, we will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- All API endpoints require JWT authentication
- Tokens expire after 1 hour by default
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
- API keys supported for service accounts

### Secrets Management
- Never commit credentials to the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Rotate API keys and tokens regularly
- Use HashiCorp Vault in production environments

### Network Security
- TLS/HTTPS required for production deployments
- Service-to-service communication should use mutual TLS
- Implement rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Use network policies to restrict inter-service communication

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use prepared statements for all database queries
- Implement input validation on all endpoints
- Regular security audits of dependencies

### Monitoring and Auditing
- Enable audit logging for all authentication events
- Monitor for anomalous token consumption
- Alert on repeated authentication failures
- Regular review of access logs

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Run security linting tools before committing:
   ```bash
   make security-check
   ```

2. Keep dependencies updated:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip-audit
   pip-audit
   ```

3. Never log sensitive information:
   - Passwords
   - API keys
   - JWT tokens
   - Personal data

4. Use parameterized queries for database operations

5. Validate and sanitize all user inputs

### For Operators
1. Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
2. Enable MFA where available
3. Regularly rotate credentials
4. Monitor system logs for suspicious activity
5. Keep the system and dependencies updated
6. Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

### For Users
1. Protect your API keys and tokens
2. Use strong passwords
3. Report suspicious activity immediately
4. Follow the principle of least privilege
5. Regularly review your access permissions

## Security Headers

Ensure the following security headers are configured:

```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

## Dependency Security

- All dependencies are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Manual review required for major version updates
- Security patches applied within 48 hours of disclosure

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Immediate containment of the threat
2. Assessment of impact and scope
3. Notification of affected users within 72 hours
4. Root cause analysis
5. Implementation of preventive measures
6. Post-incident review and documentation

## Compliance

DEAN is designed to help meet common compliance requirements:

- GDPR: Data protection and privacy controls
- SOC 2: Security and availability controls
- HIPAA: When properly configured with encryption

Note: Compliance is a shared responsibility. Ensure your deployment and usage align with your compliance requirements.
